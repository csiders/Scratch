Go to Scratch for Budding Computer Scientists (link on bit.ly/SAHSCS) and answer the
following questions.

You will need to create a file that is named your username and paste your answers in it.
After you have completed the questions, submit a pull request in this same repository.

1) Why is there such a "learning curve" when learning a traditional programming
language such as Java? Before you can begin to solve problems, you must first learn to read and write a new language, even when the task is simple.


2) What is learning to program ultimately about? Learning to think logically and more methodically.


3) How does Scratch "lower the bar" to programming? It allows budding scientists to focus on problems rather than syntax, and to master programmatic constructs rather than syntax.


4) What is a statement in a programming language? It's simply a directive that tells the computer to do something.


5) What is a Boolean expression? An expression that can be stated as true or false. 


6) What is a conditional statement? A statement that must be true for something to happen.


7) What is a loop used for in a programming language? It can induce mutiple executions of a statement.


8) What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable? A local variable can be used with one sprite, a global variable can be used by all sprites.


9) What is a Boolean variable? A variable that only takes on the value of true or false.


10) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered threads? Scripts


11) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered event handlers? Blocks whose labels begin with "when."


12) How many sprites are implemented in Oscartime? Nine sprites


13) How many threads are used to display the Oscartime game instructions? Three threads   


14) How many threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite? Three


15) What programming constructs does Scratch NOT support? Methods, parameters, return values, and inheritance and polymorphism.
